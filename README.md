# KnowMyWeather
This project represents a utilility Android app to allows users know the weather condition of any location in the world

# Project Description
This project seeks to demonstrate the use of best practices, tools and architecture used in Android development today. It demonstrate the use of all these
goodies to develope a simple weather app that displays weather information for a particular location. It also allow user to search locations and regions.

# Features of the APP
- A homepage that displays weather information of a location searched by the user. Infomation such as weather condition, wind speed, humidity as well as 
weather predictions for next two days with reagrds to that location.
- A search bar to allow users know the weather condition of a precise location by typing its name into the search box.

## Tools, Libraries and Api Used
- [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Android's recommended toolkit for building native UI declaratively.
- [Coroutines/Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values. A flow is 
conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [MVVM](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - Architecture used in the presentation layer. This app adopts clean architecture.
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/hilt) - Built on Dagger for Dependency Injection in Android.
- [OkHttp](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/databinding) - An HTTP+HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications
- [gson](https://github.com/google/gson) -  to deserialize JSON to data Objects
- [coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/) -  An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines. It is also Compose friendly
- [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) -  A robust architectural pattern that enables us to build
apps and software that are easier to test and maintain with a great level of ahherance to separation of concern. This achitecture is demonstrated in this 
project across 3 layers; Date, Domain and Presentation layers.
- [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com) -  Api service used in this project.
